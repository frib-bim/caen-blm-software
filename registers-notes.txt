== Protocols ==

On startup.

1. Reset DMA engine
1. Clear any pending IRQs
1. Unmask IRQs to be handled

1. Write FRIB AMC slot number

IRQ handling

1. Read and clear active IRQ mask

For DMA done IRQ see next.

DMA

1. Write start address and length
1. Write command with GO to enqueue request.  Optionally set IRQ to get notification
1. Poll response fifo count and/or wait for IRQ
1. Read response start address and actual length
1. write 1 to actual length to pop response fifo

FRIB 100Hz record

== Misc ==

From hdl/application_pico/ring_buffer/ring_buffer.v

//    When AXI Stream Slave finally starts reading from output port,        //
//    it should read faster than master writes to input port to not         //
//    miss words.                                                           //

So significant contention on the PCIe link during a DMA would, in the best case,
result in silently dropped samples.


DMA command and response queues are deep w/ 11 bit count (2047 max.).

Might be interesting to make DMA mux part of command fifo entry.

DDR and frib 100Hz record in place of dummy sources (see user_logic.v).
Add more sources.  One per DDR page.

Can read out calibration gain+offset
Linear scaling of samples could be moved into hardware :)


FW introspection.

  DMA fifo size.
  FW modification ID (site ID register or different PCI IDs?)

For eeprom, the done bit doesn't appear to be latched so the host
can't reliably detect the done condtion.
